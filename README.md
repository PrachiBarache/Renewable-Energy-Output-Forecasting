# Renewable-Energy-Output-Forecasting 


### **1. Introduction**
This project is designed to process and analyze energy-related data using machine learning. Following are the key steps like loading, cleaning, visualizing, and modeling data using various machine learning techniques. Below, we break down each function to explain what it does and why it was designed that way.

### **2. Function Breakdown**

#### **2.1 load_data(file_path)**
-  Reads the CSV file and load it into a structured format.

#### **2.2 clean_data(df)**
- Cleans the dataset by handling missing values and resetting the index.
- **Why this approach?**
  - Removing missing values is straightforward but might discard useful data.

#### **2.3 normalize_column(df, column_name)**
  - Min-Max scaling is used for normalization to ensure all values have the same scaling between 0 and 1, which helps models learn efficiently without bias toward larger numbers.

#### **2.4 visualize_data(df, x_col, y_col)**
-  Generates a scatter plot to help identify trends and relationships between two variables.

#### **2.5 train_model(df, feature_cols, target_col)**
-  Trains multiple machine learning models to predict the target variable.
- **Models Used:**
  - **Linear Regression**: A simple and interpretable model useful for linear relationships.
  - **Decision Trees**: Captures non-linear relationships but can overfit if not pruned properly.
  - **Random Forest**: An ensemble technique that improves accuracy and reduces overfitting.
  - **Gradient Boosting**: A more advanced ensemble method that builds strong models sequentially.
  - Using multiple models allows for comparison and selection of the best-performing one.
  - Ensemble methods like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting should outperform single models.

#### **2.6 predict(model, df, feature_cols)**
-  Uses the trained model to generate predictions based on input data.
  - Straightforward and allows easy integration into applications.
  - Could include uncertainty estimation for better decision-making.

#### **2.7 evaluate_model(model, df, feature_cols, target_col)**
-  Evaluates the performance of the trained model using different metrics.
- **Metrics Used:**
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures prediction errors, but is sensitive to outliers.
  - **RÂ² Score**: Indicates how well the model explains variance in the target variable.
  - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Gives a more interpretable error measure compared to MSE.
