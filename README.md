# Renewable-Energy-Output-Forecasting 


### **1. Introduction**

### **2. Function Breakdown**

#### **2.1 load_data(file_path)**
-  Reads the CSV file and load it into a structured format.

#### **2.2 clean_data(df)**
- Cleans the dataset by handling missing values and resetting the index.
- **Why this approach?**
  - Removing missing values is straightforward but might discard useful data.

#### **2.3 normalize_column(df, column_name)**
  - Min-Max scaling is used for normalization to ensure all values have the same scaling between 0 and 1, which helps models learn efficiently without bias toward larger numbers.

#### **2.4 visualize_data(df, x_col, y_col)**
-  Generates a scatter plot to help identify trends and relationships between two variables.

#### **2.5 train_model(df, feature_cols, target_col)**
-  Trains multiple machine learning models to predict the target variable.
- **Models Used:**
  - **Linear Regression**: A simple and interpretable model useful for linear relationships.
  - **Decision Trees**: Captures non-linear relationships but can overfit if not pruned properly.
  - **Random Forest**: An ensemble technique that improves accuracy and reduces overfitting.
  - **Gradient Boosting**: A more advanced ensemble method that builds strong models sequentially.
  - Using multiple models allows for comparison and selection of the best-performing one.
  - Ensemble methods like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting should outperform single models.

#### **2.6 predict(model, df, feature_cols)**
-  Uses the trained model to generate predictions based on input data.
  - Straightforward and allows easy integration into applications.
  - Could include uncertainty estimation for better decision-making.

#### **2.7 evaluate_model(model, df, feature_cols, target_col)**
-  Evaluates the performance of the trained model using different metrics.
- **Metrics Used:**
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures prediction errors, but is sensitive to outliers.
  - **R² Score**: Indicates how well the model explains variance in the target variable.
  - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Gives a more interpretable error measure compared to MSE.

## Comprehensive Model Performance Analysis

### Solar Generation Models (Quantitative Comparison)
1. **Linear Regression**:
   - MAE: 2.75
   - RMSE: 4.07
   - R²: 0.9914 ← **Highest R²**
   - Best overall performance by R² metric

2. **Gradient Boosting**:
   - MAE: 2.66 ← **Lowest MAE**
   - RMSE: 5.00
   - R²: 0.9871
   - Best at minimizing absolute errors

3. **Random Forest**:
   - MAE: 2.79
   - RMSE: 5.39
   - R²: 0.9850
   - Slightly lower performance than the other ML models

4. **Prophet**:
   - MAE: 5.30
   - RMSE: 7.58
   - R²: 0.9703
   - Significantly higher errors than the ML models

5. **ARIMA**:
   - Not successfully evaluated due to file path error
   - Error message indicates alignment issues between endogenous and exogenous variables

### Wind Generation Models (Quantitative Comparison)
1. **Linear Regression**:
   - MAE: 5.80 ← **Lowest MAE**
   - RMSE: 7.33 ← **Lowest RMSE**
   - R²: 0.8490 ← **Highest R²**
   - Best overall performance for wind forecasting

2. **Gradient Boosting**:
   - MAE: 6.23
   - RMSE: 7.76
   - R²: 0.8306
   - Second-best performance

3. **Random Forest**:
   - MAE: 6.27
   - RMSE: 7.81
   - R²: 0.8285
   - Very close to Gradient Boosting

4. **Prophet**:
   - MAE: 14.05
   - RMSE: 17.46
   - R²: 0.1430
   - Extremely poor performance
   - The low R² (0.14) indicates it barely outperforms a simple mean model

5. **ARIMA**:
   - Not successfully evaluated due to same error as with solar generation

## Key Insights from Metrics

1. **Overall Model Performance**:
   - **Solar forecasting** is significantly more accurate (R² > 0.97 for all models) than **wind forecasting** (R² < 0.85)
   - This confirms our visual analysis of the predictability difference between the two generation types

2. **Best Model Selection**:
   - For **solar generation**: Linear Regression provides the best balance of accuracy metrics
   - For **wind generation**: Linear Regression unexpectedly outperforms more complex models

3. **Model Complexity vs. Performance**:
   - The simpler Linear Regression model outperforms more complex models
   - This suggests that:
     - The relationships may be largely linear
     - The complex models might be overfitting despite cross-validation efforts
     - Feature engineering has captured most of the important relationships

4. **Time Series Models Limitations**:
   - ARIMA implementation faced technical issues
   - Prophet performs acceptably for solar (R² = 0.97) but fails for wind (R² = 0.14)
   - This reinforces our observation that wind patterns require models that can capture short-term fluctuations

5. **Error Magnitude Context**:
   - For solar: MAE around 2.7 units on values ranging from 0-150+ units is excellent
   - For wind: MAE around 6 units on values typically between 0-100 units is good but less precise

## Revised Recommendations

Based on both the visual analysis and quantitative metrics:

1. **For Production Deployment**:
   - **Solar Generation**: Use Linear Regression as primary model with Gradient Boosting as backup
   - **Wind Generation**: Use Linear Regression as primary model with ensemble approach for critical applications

2. **Feature Engineering Priority**:
   - Maintain focus on the key features identified (24h lag for solar, 3h rolling for wind)
   - The strong performance of Linear Regression suggests these engineered features have effectively linearized the problem

3. **Model Improvement Areas**:
   - For solar: Focus on improving nighttime/daytime transition periods
   - For wind: Explore hybrid approaches that might better capture extreme values

4. **Operational Recommendations**:
   - Use different confidence intervals for solar vs. wind predictions
   - Solar predictions can be used with higher confidence (narrower intervals)
   - Wind predictions require wider confidence intervals, especially for peak values

5. **Failed Model Handling**:
   - Troubleshoot ARIMA model issues by addressing index alignment
   - Consider alternatives to Prophet for wind forecasting given its poor performance

These metrics validate much of our visual analysis while providing important quantitative precision about the relative performance of each model.
